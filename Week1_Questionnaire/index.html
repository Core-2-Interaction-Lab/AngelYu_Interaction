    <h3> Prompts </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Describe your previous experiences with coding.</li>
       
            <p> Classes I have taken where I have been exposed to HTML/CSS/JS is my Core 1: interaction in 2022 of Fall semester. That class was the only experience I have with coding.</p>
    
            <p> The parts of the class that resonated with me was using css to decorate the website and designing how I want the website to look.</p>
        
            <p> The parts that were most confusing was using flex box to create a calender. The width of the boxes were not responding to my code and I have not gotten helpful advice or code as to how to fix it.</p>

            <li> How excited about learning code are you?</li>
            <p> I am extremely excited to learn about coding. I want to learn how to be properly efficient with my code and pursue a career with my experience. I have been interested in code since highschool and was deciding whether to go to college for computer science or graphic design.
            <p> I am somewhat nervous about learning code becaues I will encounter some problems I may not know how to solve. Luckily, the internet is filled with answers and open code sources to help my problems.
            I am also nervous about javascript and backend coding because it is not something I am familiar with, but I want to master it. </p>

            <li> How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
            <p> I imagine code to fit into almost everything in my design curriculum. I aspire to be a website designing or a graphic designer that specializes in front and back end coding. 
                I also want to pursue UX/UI and interaction design, and learning how to code will bring my creations to life.
            </p>

            <li> What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
            <p> I prefer Visual Studio code because a lot of my friends use it who are in the engineering, software, and computer science field. My last professor made us use Atom and I am not sure why. 
                Just from my past 10 minutes of using Visual Studio Code, it is already more efficient than Atom. I am very happy to finally be using a proper text editor that can be used in the real world.</p>

            <li> Have you used Github before?</li>
            <p> I have dabbled in Github slightly from last year. I know what Github is because a lot of my friends use it to share their code.</p>

            <li> Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
            <p> HTML and CSS are front-end coding--what the user can visually see. Html is the basic structure of a website, which contains words, symbols, numbers, and boxes. Html is very basic, simple, and will not look pretty. 
                An analogy for this is the barebones of a building: the pillars, windows, doors, and frames. In addition, adding rooms, like a bathroom, living room, offices, and overall separating the space into different rooms. </p>
              
            <p> Css is the tool to decorate your HTML, making your basic default font and size look pretty. CSS lets you also change the color of any element, adjust how the window interacts with different resolution sizes, add animation, shapes, and edit or add an image.
                An analogy for this could be adding plants, wallpaper, lights, and flooring for a building. </p>

            <p> Javascript is back-end coding of a website. The element you can not visually see when you first look at a website, but until you inspect the page.</p>
            <p> Javascript affects how the user interacts with the HTML elements and how a website functions. Adding sounds, pushing buttons, and advanced animations when hovering, clicking, or scrollig through a website.</p>
            <p> An anaology of this is the electrical, plumbing, cooling, and heating system of a building or the hinges of the doors and windows. </p>

            <li> Use HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance.</li>

            <h1> Thai food: Pad Sew Ew</h1>
            <h2> Japanese food: Sushi</h2>
            <h3> Japanese food: Udon and Soba</h3>
            <h4> United States: New England Clam Chowder</h4>
            <h5> Mexican food: Baja Fish Tacos</h5>
            <h6> Seafood: Lobster</h6>

            <li> Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://codepen.io/"> Code Pen </a> : I like to use this website to find other people's projects and different coding structions for creating different elements. There is also some really cool art pieces made from strictly algorithm and code. </li>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.behance.net/onboarding/adobe"> Behance </a> : I just discovered this website, but apparently it is a graphic design inspiration website. I have ever used one of these, but it is interesting to find one. Credits to Destiny for introducing me. </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li> Insert an image that brings you joy to the page</li>
